# PitchEstimation
PitchEstimation Project for the subband encoding pitch estimation algorithm proposed in: 
 1. Robust Pitch Estimation and Tracking for Speakers Based on Subband
   Encoding and the Generalized Labeled Multi-Bernoulli Filter. 
   IEEE/ACM Transactions on Audio, Speech, and Language Processing, 27(4),
   827-841. 2019.
 2. A New Frequency Coverage Metric and a New Subband Encoding Model, with
   an Application in Pitch Estimation, pp. 2147-2151. Interspeech 2018. 
   
This project provides an example of using the algorithm, via simple steps:  
 1. run the program named SubbandEncodingPitchEstimation.m  
 2. select the folder that contains the speech sound file to be estimated. 
 3. a folder will be created to save the resulting pitch estimates and plots.
